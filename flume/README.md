## Quick Background: Apache Zookeeper

Zookeeper enables applications developers to focus mainly on their applications
logic rather than coordination tasks, ideally separates application data from
control or coordination data. It expose a simple API. inspired by the
filesystem API, that allows developers to implement common coordination tasks,
such as selecting a master server, managing group membership, and managing
metadata.
