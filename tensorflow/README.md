## Quick Background: TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source software library released in 2015 by Google to
make it easier for developers to design, build, and train deep learning models.
TensorFlow originated as an internal library that Google developers used to
build models in-house.

Starting in 2011, Google Brain built DistBelief as their first-generation,
proprietary, machine learning system (specillaly designed for Deep Learning, a 
branch of Machine Learning). TensorFlow was Google Brain's second generation 
machine learning system, which was released as open source on November 9, 2015. 
While the reference implementation runs on single devices, TensorFlow can run 
on multiple CPUs and GPUs (with optional CUDA extensions).

At a high level, TensorFlow is a Python library that allows users to express
arbitrary computation as a graph of data flows.

## Why is important TensorFlow in a Big Data ecosystem?

TensorFlow is basically a software library for numerical computation. We could
include this tool in the segment of Octave, Scilab, R or Pandas. Traditionally
this kind of tools are used in Hight Performance Computing (or Grid Computing)
environments, on top or resource managers such as SGE, HTCondor or SLURM.

Nevertheless Big Data and HPC are hand by hand related, the more data we
collect, the more computational capacity we need to analyze the data.
Machine learning is well suited to the complexity of dealing with disparate
data sources and the huge variety of variables and amounts of data involved. 

With machine learning we need computation power and massive data processing
(data driven), this is a kind of technology where massive CPU power and massive
data I/O converge together.

## Getting started CUDA

### CUDA setting up

The following steps are carry out based on Fedora 24 and an ancient NVIDIA GPU.

The GPU used is one of the first CUDA able generations from NVIDIA. The
hardware used for this test is a NVIDIA Geforce 210.

We have to install the 340.xx Legacy drivers (last driver with GeForce 210 
support), in order to run this tests with our NVIDIA avaiable for this proof.

Installing the CUDA driver:

We have to install a CUDA tookit with support for Geforce 210, the last CUDA
tookit with support for this hardware is the version CUDA 6.5 series. after
thsi version the support of this device was deprecated.

Installing the CUDA tookit for programming with  Cuda Driver API and cuda
Runtime API:

``````
wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_5/rel/installers/cuda_6.5.14_linux_64.run
sh cuda_6.5.14_linux_64.run -silent -samples -toolkit --override

dnf install compat-gcc-34 compat-gcc-34-c++ -y
cd /usr/local/cuda-6.5/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
GCC=g++34 make
./deviceQuery 

``````

## Important note

The GPU-enabled version of TensorFlow has the following requirements:

- NVIDIA CUDAÂ® 7.5 (CUDA 8.0 required for Pascal GPUs)

- NVIDIA cuDNN v4.0 (minimum) or v5.1 (recommended)

We will also need an NVIDIA GPU supporting compute capability 3.0 or higher.

Unfortunatly in this project we only have a NVDIA GPU with compute capability
1.2 and we have to use NVIDIA CUDA 6.5

We will have to focus on TensorFlow using scalar CPUs and study the CUDA
capabilities in other project within this project.
