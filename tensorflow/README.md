## Quick Background: TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source software library released in 2015 by Google to
make it easier for developers to design, build, and train deep learning models.
TensorFlow originated as an internal library that Google developers used to
build models in-house.

Starting in 2011, Google Brain built DistBelief as their first-generation,
proprietary, machine learning system. TensorFlow was Google Brain's second
generation machine learning system, which was released as open source on 
November 9, 2015. While the reference implementation runs on single devices, 
TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs (with optional CUDA extensions).

At a high level, TensorFlow is a Python library that allows users to express
arbitrary computation as a graph of data flows.
