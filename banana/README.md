## Quick Background: Lucidworks Banana

The Banana project works with all kinds of time series (and non-time series)
data stored in Apache Solr. It uses powerful dashboard configuration
capabilities, ports key panels to work with Solr, and provides significant
additional capabilities.  The goal is to create a rich and flexible UI, 
enabling users to rapidly develop end-to-end applications that leverage 
the power of Apache Solr.

The Banana project was forked from the popular Kibana project by Lucidworks,
a San Francisco, California-based enterprise search technology company focused
in Apache Solr technology.


## Why is important Lucidworks Banana in a Big Data ecosystem?

Kibana is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It
provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an
Elasticsearch cluster. This tool together with Logstah and Elasticsearch are
stongly spread around open source comunities. However Kibana is copled to
Elasticsearch, so the possibility to use this powerful visualization tool in
top other of the most important search engines, such as Apache Solr is a beneficious step
for the Big Data open source community.

This is the work done by Luciworks with Banana fork.
