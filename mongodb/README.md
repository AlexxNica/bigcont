## Quick Background: MongoDB

MongoDB is a document-oriented database, a kind of NoSQL database, not a
relational one. NoSQL solutions were not created for the same purposes as SQL.
While SQL is mainly dedicated for structured data and to handle transactions,
NoSQL solutions were created to resolve the storage problems of massive
unstructured datasets.

NoSQL databases can be classied using different approaches and various criteria.
Some experts classify them according to their data model. MongoDB is
classified as Document Store or Document Oriented database.

A document-oriented database replaces the concept of a “row” with a more
flexible model, the “document”.

MongoDB was designed to scale out. Its document-oriented data model makes it 
easier for it to split up data across multiple servers. MongoDB automatically 
takes care of balancing data and load across a cluster, redistributing 
documents automatically and routing user requests to the correct machines.
Scale up the cluster (when we need more nodes) is as easy as to add new machines,
and MongoDB will figure out how the existing data should be spread to them.

## Why is important MongoDB in a Big Data ecosystem?

MongoDB is very scalable, has high reliability, low initial cost (low learning
curve). It is the foundation of a plethora of tools (as internal database) and
frequently is the NoSQL database of election for Big Data programmers: it's easy
to use. It's one of the most popular NoSQL databases in the Big Data scene.
