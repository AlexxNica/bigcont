## Quick Background: Logstash

Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities.
Logstash can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into 
destinations of your choice. Cleanse and democratize all your data for diverse advanced 
downstream analytics and visualization use cases.

While Logstash originally drove innovation in log collection, its capabilities extend 
well beyond that use case. Any type of event can be enriched and transformed with a 
broad array of input, filter, and output plugins, with many native codecs further 
simplifying the ingestion process. Logstash accelerates your insights by harnessing 
a greater volume and variety of data.
